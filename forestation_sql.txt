--Write out a set of recommendations as an analyst on the ForestQuery team. 
--●	What have you learned from the World Bank data? 
--●	Which countries should we focus on over others?



Between 1990 and 2016, the world has lost 41282694.9 square kilometers of forests. This is a decrease of 3.2% of the world's total forest as is an area the size of Peru that has been lost. 
Dispite this grim outlook, the regions of South Asia and Middle East & North Africa have increased in their total forest area with China seeing an increase of 527229 square kilometers. 
The largest country of concern is Brazil which has lost 1324449 square kilometers and every effort should now be made to reverse this decline. The other countries that have seen the largest decline in their forest areas are Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria and Tanzania. When considering those countries that have lost the largest percentage of their forest, Togo is an alarming example which has lost over 75% of its total forest. The countries with the four highest rates of deforestation are all in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. This is a region that focus should be applied to. With the success story of China, increasing the total forest area it is recommended to employ the strategies used by China in the countries with the highest deforestation figures in order to collaborate with the most at risk countries and regions in an effort to revers this staggering decline of the World's forests.
